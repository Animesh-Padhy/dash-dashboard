# Interactive Web Pages with HTML, Bootstrap, and Dash

This project involves creating interactive web pages using Dash HTML, Dash Bootstrap, and Dash by Plotly. The dashboard is divided into assignments, each building on the previous one to create a comprehensive data visualization tool using the Gapminder dataset. The final output is a dynamic web application that visualizes GDP data in a pie chart based on user inputs.

## Assignment Breakdown

### Assignment 1 & 2

**Objective:** Create a web page using HTML, Bootstrap, and Dash core components.

**Tasks:**

1. **Setup:** Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (`dash`, `plotly`, etc.).
2. **Web Page Structure:** Use HTML and Bootstrap to create a structured and styled web page.
3. **Dropdown and Radio Items:** Utilize the Gapminder dataset from Plotly to populate dropdown menus and radio items for user interaction.

**Outcome:** A web page with interactive components (dropdowns and radio items) powered by the Gapminder dataset.

### Assignment 3

**Objective:** Create a pie chart using callbacks and the Gapminder dataset.

**Tasks:**

1. **Setup Callbacks:** Implement a callback function in Dash that updates the pie chart based on the selected countries.
2. **Data Visualization:** Use the selected countries to filter the Gapminder dataset and display the GDP in a pie chart.

**Outcome:** An interactive pie chart that dynamically updates based on user-selected countries.

### Assignment 4

**Objective:** Enhance the pie chart with a button-triggered display using state callbacks.

**Tasks:**

1. **Modify Assignment 3 Code:** Integrate a button that triggers the display of the pie chart.
2. **State Callbacks:** Use state callbacks in Dash to ensure the pie chart only updates when the button is pressed.

**Outcome:** A more interactive pie chart that only updates and displays GDP data when the user presses a button.
